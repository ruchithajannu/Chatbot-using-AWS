This project explores the development of a chatbot using Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing platform. The chatbot utilizes various AWS services to streamline its functionality and enhance user interaction.

By leveraging AWS services, developers can streamline the development process, enhance scalability, and deliver a seamless conversational experience to users. This abstract provides an overview of the key components and functionalities of the chatbot architecture, highlighting the benefits of utilizing AWS for building intelligent and interactive chatbot solutions.

Amazon Lex for Natural Language Understanding: Amazon Lex, a service for building conversational interfaces, is employed to comprehend user intents and extract relevant information from their queries. Lex abstracts away the complexities of natural language processing, enabling seamless interaction between users and the chatbot.

AWS Lambda for Business Logic Execution: AWS Lambda functions are utilized to execute the chatbot's business logic in response to user inputs. By leveraging Lambda's serverless computing model, developers can focus on writing code to handle specific intents and actions without concerning themselves with infrastructure management.

System Requirements :

AWS Account: You'll need an AWS account to access and utilize the various AWS services required for building the chatbot.

Development Environment:
  Operating System: The development environment can be set up on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  Code Editor system: Any code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Atom.
  AWS CLI (Command Line Interface): Install AWS CLI to interact with AWS services from the command line.
  Programming Languages: We need proficiency in one or more programming languages such as Python, Node.js, or Java.
  
AWS Services:
  Amazon Lex: Utilize Lex for natural language understanding and conversation management.
  AWS Lambda: Write serverless functions to implement business logic and respond to user inputs.
